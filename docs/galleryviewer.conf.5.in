.SH NAME
galleryviewer.conf \- configuration file format for galleryviewer

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B galleryviewer.conf
is the configuration file format for
.BR galleryviewer (1).
Use it to set default settings and custom template locations.
.PP
.B galleryviewer.conf
uses an INI-style format.
Sections are delimited by square braces: [ ].
Within each section are key/value pairs separated by
an equals sign (\[aq]=\[aq]) or a colon (\[aq]:\[aq]).
Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from keys and values.
Comments are delimited by a semicolon (\[aq];\[aq]) or a hash
(\[aq]#\[aq]) character at the beginning of the comment,
and are terminated by the end of line character.
.PP
The following sections are used in the
.B galleryviewer.conf
file.
.TP
.B [options]
Contains default settings for some optional arguments.
.TP
.B [profiles]
Contains a series of profiles.
Profiles are short names for paths on the file system where custom
templates can be located.

.SH "THE [options] SECTION"
.PP
Some options defaults can be set via configuration file.
.TP
.BI "profile = " string
Will be passed to the
.B \-\-profile
option.
.TP
.BI "data\-file = " string
Will be passed to the
.B \-\-data-file
option.
.TP
.BI "test = " boolean
Turns the
.B \-\-test
and
.B \-\-no\-test
options on and off.
.TP
.BR "case =" " {consider, ignore}"
A value of "consider" sets the
.B \-\-consider\-case
option.
A value of "ignore" sets the
.B \-\-ignore-case
option.
.TP
.BR "sort =" " {none, ascii, human, default}"
Sets the value of the
.B \-\-sort
option.
.PP
Option values that are not the correct type will generate a warning
message.
Option names are case insensitive.
Recognized values for boolean options are \[aq]yes\[aq]/\[aq]no\[aq],
\[aq]on\[aq]/\[aq]off\[aq], \[aq]true\[aq]/\[aq]false\[aq], and
\[aq]1\[aq]/\[aq]0\[aq], case-insensitive.
See
.BR galleryviewer (1)
for the meaning of these options.

.SH "THE [profiles] SECTION"
.PP
The keys in this section are the profile names.
The values are the paths that this name will be expanded to.
A leading tilde character (\[aq]~\[aq]) in the path
will be expanded to the user\[aq]s home directory.
So, as an example profile setting:
.IP
\f[C]profile1 = ~/Templates/galleryviewer\f[R]
.PP
will allow the selection of templates located under the directory
\f[C]~/Templates/galleryviewer/\f[R]
via the profile name
.IR profile1 ,
using the
.B \-\-profile
option of
.BR galleryviewer (1).
In the argument, separate the profile name
from the template name with a slash (\[aq]/\[aq]).
In the above example, the argument
"\f[I]profile1\f[R]/\f[I]template.html\f[R]"
would select a file named "\f[I]template.html\f[R]"
located in the directory
\f[C]~/Templates/galleryviewer/\f[R].

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/galleryviewer.conf
The system wide configuration file.
.TP
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/galleryviewer/config " or " ~/.config/galleryviewer/config
Per user configuration file.
.PP
The configuration will be read in the above order,
with values in later files overriding.
Files with lines that cannot be parsed (due to syntax errors)
will be skipped and not read.

.SH EXAMPLE

[options]
profile = user/my_template.html

case = ignore
