.SH NAME
galleryviewer \- create an HTML viewer for images

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B galleryviewer
.RI [ option ]...
.IR PATHS ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.B galleryviewer
will take a series of
.I PATHS
to image files, sort them (by default),
place them within an HTML template,
and write the resultant file (by default to standard output).
The result is an HTML document for browsing and viewing the images.
.SS Custom templates
.PP
.B galleryviewer
uses Jinja templates to create the output HTML document.
It comes packaged with two built-in templates
(that differ only in color scheme) that can be selected via the
.B \-\-profile
option as
"builtin/default.html" and "builtin/dark.html".
Modify or extend these templates to create custom templates,
or consult Jinja's
.UR https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates
Template Designer Documentation
.UE
to make one from scratch.
.PP
For all templates, there are three variables available in the template:
.TP
title: string
Name of current directory or argument to
.B \-\-title
if given.
.TP
data: object
Contains whatever data was decoded from the
.SM JSON
formatted file given to
.BR \-\-data\-file ,
as decoded by Python's default
.SM JSON
decoder, json.JSONDecoder.
.TP
files: list of ImagePath objects
Each ImagePath object has three attributes:
(1) arg, the original file name argument passed in;
(2) index, the order it was passed in (zero indexed) before any sorting;
and (3) path,
the pathlib.Path representation of the file's path.
See the pathlib module for the many methods and properties
available for operating on the path.
.PP
The quickest way to use a custom template is to pass the template's
path to the
.B \-\-template
option.
.PP
For a more robust method, create a configuration file
and configure profiles.
Profiles are short names for paths on the file system where custom
templates can be located.
See
.BR galleryviewer.conf (5)
for the way to do this.
Custom templates can then be selected by passing a
.I PROFILE
argument to the
.B \-\-profile
option.
In the argument,
separate the profile name from the template name with a slash.
So, for an example profile named
.I profile1
and an example template named
.I template.html
the argument would be
"\f[I]profile1\f[R]/\f[I]template.html\f[R]".
The profile name will be expanded to
the path value from the configuration file.
If there is no slash in the argument
it is assumed to be just a profile name,
and the default template name, "default.html",
will be appended automatically.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Show the help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Show the program version number and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-d\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]\-\-data\-file=\f[R]\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Load data from
.I FILE
in
.SM JSON
format.
Not used by the built-in templates,
but provides a way of loading data into custom templates.
.TP
\f[B]\-o\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]\-\-output=\f[R]\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Place output into
.IR FILE .
If this option is omitted, the default is to write to standard output.
.TP
\f[B]\-p\f[R] \f[I]PROFILE\f[R], \f[B]\-\-profile=\f[R]\f[I]PROFILE\f[R]
Use
.I PROFILE
instead of the default profile, "builtin/default.html".
See the above section about Custom templates to use this option to select
custom templates.
.TP
\f[B]\-t\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]\-\-template=\f[R]\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Load template directly from
.IR FILE .
.TP
.BR \-\-test " | " \-\-no\-test
Exit if not all
.I PATHS
exist as files.
.TP
\f[B]\-T\f[R] \f[I]TITLE\f[R], \f[B]\-\-title=\f[R]\f[I]TITLE\f[R]
Custom <title>.
.SS Sorting options
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-check\-sort
Do not emit HTML.
Instead print
.I PATHS
in the chosen sorting order, to ensure the order is correct.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-consider\-case " | " \-f ", " \-\-ignore\-case
Turn case-sensitive sorting of
.I PATHS
on or off.
.TP
.BI "\-\-sort=" "WORD"
.I WORD
can be one of three possible sort methods:
.RS
.TP
"none"
Do not sort.
Include
.I PATHS
exactly as they are given on the command line.
.RB "Aliases: " \-U " or " \-\-no\-sort .
.TP
"ascii"
Lexicographic sort.
This is the sorting method already used by the shell.
If you pass a glob like \f[C]*.jpg\f[],
the file names matching that glob will be expanded by the shell in
.SM ASCII
or lexicographic sorting order.
.TP
"human"
Human or natural or \[lq]version\[rq] sort.
This treats numbers within pathnames specially,
sorting them in numeric order rather than lexicographic order.
This is the sorting method used by most graphical file managers.
This is the default value for
.BR \-\-sort .
.RE
.TP
.BR \-U ", " \-\-no\-sort
Do not sort
.IR PATHS .

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
0
Normal exit.
.TP
1
Exited because
.B \-\-test\-paths
was requested and one or more
.I PATHS
failed to exist.
.TP
2
Error with parsing command-line arguments.
.TP
100
Error with decoding argument to
.B \-\-data\-file
as
.SM JSON.
.TP
101
Error with loading or parsing the requested template.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/galleryviewer.conf
The system wide configuration file. See
.BR galleryviewer.conf (5)
for further details.
.TP
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/galleryviewer/config " or " ~/.config/galleryviewer/config
Per user configuration file. See
.BR galleryviewer.conf (5)
for further details.
.PP
The configuration will be read in the above order,
with values in later files overriding.
Configuration files with lines that cannot be parsed (due to syntax errors)
will be skipped and not read.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
\f[C]galleryviewer -o index.html 1.jpg 10.jpg 2.jpg\f[R]
.PP
Write an HTML document for viewing to index.html.
.IP
\f[C]galleryviewer *.jpg > index.html\f[R]
.PP
Functionally the same example as the first, but using shell features:
globbing to select matching pathnames in the current directory
and redirection to place standard output into a file.
